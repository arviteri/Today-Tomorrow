# Today Tomorrow

Live life one day at a time. 

Today Tomorrow is a to-do list specifically for today. It was created to replace the paper to-do list I use daily. 


## Features of Today Tomorrow include... 

### Automatic Deletion: 

Items that have been completed are removed from the database at the end of the day. Items that have not been completed will remain in your to-do list.

<br />

### Get Ready For Tomorrow:

To get ahead of the game and to be prepared, Today Tomorrow provides a to-do list for tomorrow as well. All items from Tomorrow's to-do list will move into Today's to-do list after midnight. Tomorrow's to-do list does not display daily items.

### Daily Item: 

Mark an item as a 'Daily Item' to reset the item at the end of the day without having it dissapear. To mark an item as a 'Daily Item' swipe over the item from the right to reveal the item's options. Tap on "Mark As Daily." Unmarking the item follows the same process. Daily Item's are marked with a bullet point.

### Swipe Deletion:

No longer have to do an item? You can delete the item by swiping from the right to reveal the item's options and tapping delete. You can also use Swipe Deletion by dragging the item all the way across the screen. Swipe Deletion is a feature provided through the Cocoapod 'SwipeCellKit'

<br />

### Important To-Do's:

Today Tomorrow was inspired by a 'Must-Do'/'Should-Do' list. When creating an item, tap "Must Do" if this is an item that you must do. Tap "Should Do" if this is an item that you should do. 'Must-Do' items are displayed on the top of the list in black. 'Should-Do' items are displayed at the bottom of the list in dark-gray.

### Today Extension:

Today Tomorrow offers a Today Extension which displays all of today's uncompleted items which are not Daily Item's
